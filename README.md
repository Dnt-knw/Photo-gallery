## About adding your photos

### There are 2 ways for photo adding

- Using the "Upload photos" input
- Using the Drag & Drop inside your folder

## What are the limitations?

### Oh, yes, about the limitations, it is strictly forbidden to use the following characters in the names of folders and photos

- __Backslash__
- __Forward slash__
- __Dot__
- __Asterisk__
- __Question mark__
- __Two and more spaces__
- __One space at the end__

### Valid name of photos and folders

- __Folder names must be unique__
- __The names of the photos must be unique too__

But there is something... In the app, you only see the name of your photo without specifying the format. 
You should keep in mind that "Photo.jpg " and "Photo.png" are two completely different photos. 
Also avoid adding copies of photos.

## Browser support

I have tested my project in different browsers and below is the __browser support for my project.__

| Microsoft Edge | Google Chrome | Yandex browser | Mozilla Firefox  | Opera | Safari |
|------|------|------|------|------|------|
| Full support | Full support | Full support | Full support | Full support | Partial support |

In particular, there is a problem with renaming photos on iOS and mobile devices. 
In order for everything to work, you need to restart the app after renaming the photos.

Tested on the __latest versions__ of browsers.
