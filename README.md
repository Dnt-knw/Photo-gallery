## ❗️ About adding your photos ❗️

### There are 2 ways for photo adding 🖼️

- 📜 Using the "Upload photos" input
- 📜 Using the Drag & Drop inside your folder

## ❗️ What are the limitations? ❗️

### Strictly forbidden to use the following characters in the names of folders and photos ⛔️

- __Backslash__ ❌
- __Forward slash__ ❌
- __Dot__ ❌
- __Asterisk__ ❌
- __Question mark__ ❌
- __Two and more spaces__ ❌
- __One space at the end__ ❌

### Identical names ⛔

- __Folder names must be unique__ ✅
- __The names of the photos must be unique too__ ✅

📌 Keep in mind that you need to write a unique name __only for 1 photo format__. 
If you have "cool_photo.jpg", you cannot rename another photo to "cool_photo" name, if it __also has jpg format__. 
This means that "cool_photo.jpg" you can store __only in 1 copy__. And conversely, "cool_photo.jpg" and "cool_photo.png" are __completely different photos__ due to their different formats

📌 You don't see the photo format in the app, but if something goes wrong, __the app will warn you__ about it

## ❗️ Browser support ❗️

### I have tested my app in different browsers and below is the browser support

| Microsoft Edge | Google Chrome | Yandex browser | Mozilla Firefox  | Opera | Safari |
|------|------|------|------|------|------|
| Full support | Full support | Full support | Full support | Full support | Partial support |

📌 In particular, there are 2 problems on iOS

1. 🚫 The problem with renaming photos. In order for everything to work, you need to restart the app after renaming the photos
2. 🚫 The problem with memory access. There is no way to check the amount of occupied and free memory

Tested on the __latest versions__ of browsers ✅
